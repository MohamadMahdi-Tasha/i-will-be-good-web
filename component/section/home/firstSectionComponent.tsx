                        Sertraline and risperidone are two medications that have been used to treat depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD), a condition characterized by persistent or recurrent feelings of detachment or unreality regarding oneself and/or the environment. However, the evidence for their effectiveness is limited and inconsistent.

                        <br/>
                        For people with DDD, SSRIs (Sertraline) have been found to be effective at treating the depression that people often experience along with their depersonalization
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        However, risperidone has not been shown to improve the core symptoms of depersonalization and derealization, and may have significant side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, movement disorders, and increased prolactin levels2
